# MBTA Commute

## Summmary
This web app is is intended to help you stay on top of service alerts and the next arrival of your bus, train or boat in your commute
on the MBTA (Boston Area public transportation). You can set up your commute (or multiple commute options) and list each line that you use.
On the main page it will alert you to next arrival preditions and of any service alerts. Unlike other apps this shows you an overall 
view of your commute instad of just one line at a time. This is an advantage for those who have to utilize multiple lines per commute.

##JavaScript Libraries used
- jQuery
- AngularJS

##APIs used

##Features
This project is still in the works. I am still working to refine features and develop new ones. Here is a list of what is available and what is to come.

###Current features
- Dashboard screen to list all of your defined commutes. It shows arrival time predictions and alerts for each line.
- User accounts. You can create an account so that your defined commutes are saved and so that you can login from any device.

###Upcoming features
- Option to build commute based on starting and destination address rather than manually defining.
- Crowd sourced service alert. Displays alerts submitted by other viewers
