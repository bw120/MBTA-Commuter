# MBTA Commute

## Summmary
This web app is is intended to help you stay on top of service alerts and the next arrival of your bus, train or boat in your commute
on the MBTA (Boston Area public transportation). You can set up your commute (or multiple commute options) and list each line that you use.
On the main page it will alert you to next arrival preditions and of any service alerts. Unlike other apps this shows you an overall 
view of your commute instad of just one line at a time. This is an advantage for those who have to utilize multiple lines per commute.
